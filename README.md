# [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) + [GEF](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/) cheatsheet

An incomplete/work-in-progress cheatsheet, mainly targeted at reversing binaries, that I wrote for my own personal use; I hope that others will find it helpful. Suggestions and PRs are welcome.

Compile the cheatsheet with: pdflatex gdb_gef-cheatsheet.tex
